# Flower Classification App üå∏

This **Flower Classification App** predicts the species of a flower based on its physical attributes (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). The app uses a pre-trained machine learning model to classify the flower species, making it easy and interactive for users to get predictions.

## Features üöÄ

- User-friendly interface built using **Streamlit**.
- Predicts flower species based on:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- Leverages a pre-trained **Linear Regression Model** for prediction.
- Real-time predictions based on user inputs.
