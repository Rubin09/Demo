# Flower Classification App 🌸

This **Flower Classification App** predicts the species of a flower based on its physical attributes (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). The app uses a pre-trained machine learning model to classify the flower species, making it easy and interactive for users to get predictions.
